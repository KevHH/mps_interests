# Outside Interests
All code used in the making of the final project.
- /scripts/ : scrapers and misc scripts used to gather and process all the data from Register of MPs' Outside Interests.
- /server/ : PHP files for the "search the register" function (redundant as incorporated into view as I chose to host on IGOR)
- /view/ : Public HTML and JS files, including final data and code for all charts.
